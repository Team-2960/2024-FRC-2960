# lib2960_ctre

**<ins>NOTE: This is a work in progress and has not been fully tested at this time.</ins>**

This is a library created by FRC Team 2960 Automation Nation to contain commonly used robot code.

The library is broken up by required vendor library. This is to keep unnecessary vendor libraries from being included when the part of this library that used it is not being used.

This portion of the library includes implementations of the [lib2960](https://github.com/Team-2960/lib2960) classes using the Cross the Road Electronics (CTRE) Phoenix vendor libraries.

## Prerequisites  
The following is required for this library to work correctly
- [lib2960](https://github.com/Team-2960/lib2960) submodule
- [CTRE Phoenix 6 vendor library](https://v6.docs.ctr-electronics.com/en/stable/docs/installation/installation-frc.html)

## Usage
This library is intended to be included as a Git submodule in a sub folder of a java based FRC robot project. 

Use the following steps to include this library:

1. Open your existing robot java project
2. Open the terminal by pressing ```ctrl + ` ```
3. If you do not already have a Git repository setup, initialize a git repository for your project
    - This can be done using the source control interface in VSCode
    - This can also be down by running the following commands in a terminal
        ```
        git init
        git add --all
        git commit "Initializing project repository"
        ```

4. Add this library as a submodule using the following commands in the terminal


    ```
    git submodule add https://github.com/Team-2960/lib2960_ctre.git src\main\java\frc\lib2960_ctre
    cd src\main\java\frc\lib2960_ctre
    git checkout tags/v2025.0.0-pre1
    cd ..\..\..\..\..
    ```

Once included, all git pull and clone operations must include the ```--recuse-submodules``` parameter to insure the submodule is also cloned with the main repository.
